Customer Segmentation & Retention Strategy Report

This work explores an E-commerce dataset containing over 540,000 transactions across multiple countries. The primary goal is to perform a Cohort Analysis to understand customer retention patterns â€” i.e., how often customers return after their first purchase.
By identifying retention trends, the analysis provides insights into customer loyalty, churn behaviour, and business growth opportunities.


## Methodology
The analysis follows these key steps:
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Converted InvoiceDate to datetime format.
Removed transactions without a valid CustomerID.
Created an OrderMonth column for monthly aggregation.
Cohort Assignment
Defined cohorts by each customerâ€™s first purchase month (CohortMonth).
Cohort Indexing
Calculated CohortIndex, which tracks how many months have passed since the first purchase.
Cohort Retention Table
Built a pivot table showing the number of unique returning customers per cohort over time.
Visualization
Generated a heatmap to illustrate retention trends visually.

# Cohort Analysis of E-commerce Transactions

## Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to perform cohort analysis, focusing on customer retention over time.

## Dataset
- Transactions: 541,909
- Fields: InvoiceNo, InvoiceDate, CustomerID, StockCode, Description, Quantity, UnitPrice, Country

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Enadiakhere/Customer-Segmentation-Retention-Analysis.git
cd Customer-Segmentation-Retention-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

```bash
  npm run deploy
```


## Structure
## Findings
Cohort analysis is a powerful way to track customer lifecycle behaviour.
Businesses should focus on early engagement strategies to improve retention beyond the first month.
Comparing early vs. later cohorts reveals whether marketing or product changes influenced loyalty.
## Tools used 
Python
Pandas â€“ data manipulation
Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ visualization
Jupyter Notebook â€“ documentation & analysis
